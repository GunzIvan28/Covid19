The ongoing Coronavirus pandemic and availability of [global data on outbreaks](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) has led to a flurry of different online dashboards. While there are [some fantastic examples](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6), they can in isolation be of limited use without the interpreation required.

This website aims to make it easy to get clear statistics on the progress of the COVID-19 outbreak, and provide country disaggregated statistics.

# The Data

This analysis is largely based on the John Hopkins Novel Coronavirus Dataset, which is [available here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/README.md). It is an aggregation of a range of different Coronavirus datasets, and is seen as the best globally available. Countries may offer high resolution datasets, but these are not always made publicly available in an easy format, so may not make it into the dataset.

# Contact

If you have any queries about the data, or suggestions on graphs that you would like to see included, I would love to hear from you!

# Feedback and Support

Have any graphs you would like to see made in this website? [Reach out to me](about) with suggestions and I would love to add them! This analysis is all done as voluntary work around my job, and I am competing to get time to support this work. If you would like to show your gratitude, it would be great if you could [donate](https://www.paypal.me/mikeyharper) to support this effort.
