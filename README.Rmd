This repository contains code used to clean data, analyse and visualise the Covid-19 outbreak. This data is updated daily and served to [the website](https://dr-harper.github.io/Covid19/). This GitHub repository is available for people to browse the code and use to their own interest.

# Why I made this

There are a lot of dashboards out there, but I ultimately feel that these can make it hard to interpret the data. Without context, it can be difficult to understand whether a graph which is still going upwards is good or bad news. This repository tries to pair the graphics with some context, and make it easy for people to get the graphs they need to understand the data.

# Repository Structure

For those interested in seeing more:

- `data`: contains the cleaned data, along with the scripts used to load the data
- `reports`: template files which are used to run the analysis through
- `scripts`: files used to automatically update files daily

The cleaned data outputs are available in the [data/global](https://github.com/dr-harper/Covid19/tree/master/data/global) subdirectory. This is from the [John Hopkins](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) Covid-19 database.

# Plots

If you are interested in any of the plots, the code to make them are available in the subdirectory `graphs`:

```{r}
list.files("graphs/", pattern = ".Rmd")
```
